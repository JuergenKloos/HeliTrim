# HeliTrim
HeliTrim is a simple SASL X-Plane plugin intended to make helicopter flying with a regular, self centring joysticks easier, as well as to make the experience consistent across different helicopters from different developers.
It allows users to hold down a button and release the control pressure by moving the stick to it's centre position without moving the cyclic. Position of the joystick when the button is released becomes whichever position the cyclic was at the moment, when it was pressed.
There is an option to allow trimming of the anti torque pedals too. While unrealistic, this is very helpful for users without hardware pedals that rely on twist grip.
Lastly it can also override default trim, using the default trim commands will then add to the same offset that can be created by the trim button described above. This way there isn't an extra trim that has to be reset separately, but only one trim controlled in two different ways.

The idea is that a helicopter addon can simulate the real controls authentically, without any regard for making it easier for desktop use. HeliTrim can then be used as an extra layer on top so users with regular hardware can fly them without much difficulty. This should result in better experience for both helicopter enthusiasts with expensive hardware as well as people with regular self centring joysticks, even ones using twist grip in place of anti torque pedals.

Any developers are not only allowed, but encouraged to "steal" any of it's functionality, I just want to see more authentic, accessible and overall better simulation of helicopters.
